allow/require developer to supply git branch/git commit tag? 
if this is a new module, creates the initial registration with the authenticated user as
the sole owner, then launches a build to update the dev version of the module.  You can check
the state of this build with the 'get_module_state' method passing in the git_url.  If the module
already exists, then you must be an owner to reregister.  That will immediately overwrite your
dev version of the module (old dev versions are not stored, but you can always reregister an old
version from the repo) and start a build.

data_version - optional field, reflects version of data defined in kbase.yml (see "data-version" 
    key). In case this field is set data folder with path "/kb/data/<data_folder>/<data_version>"
    should be initialized by running docker image with "init" target from catalog. And later when
    async methods are run it should be mounted on AWE worker machine into "/data" folder inside 
    docker container by execution engine.

only required: module_name or git_url, the rest are optional selectors
If no selectors given, returns current release version
version is one of: release | beta | dev
old release versions can only be retrieved individually by timestamp or git_commit_hash

Note: this method isn't particularly smart or effecient yet, because it pulls the info for a particular
module first, then searches in code for matches to the relevant query.  Instead, this should be
performed on the database side through queries.  Will optimize when this becomes an issue.

In the future, this will be extended so that you can retrieve version info by only
timestamp, git commit, etc, but the necessary indicies have not been setup yet.  In general, we will
need to add better search capabilities
